# Amazon

### Data Fetching : 
Stock data for two companies, Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL), are fetched from Yahoo Finance for the period from January 1, 2010, to June 14, 2021.

```
### Data Preprocessing: 
The closing prices of the stocks were extracted and converted into logarithmic returns. The differencing technique was applied to obtain the differenced log returns.

### Data preprocessing for Amazon
```
AMZN_closing <- Cl(to.daily(AMZN))
AMZN_dc <- Cl(to.monthly(AMZN))
AMZN_log <- log(AMZN_closing)
AMZN_diff <- diff(AMZN_log, lag = 1)
anyNA(AMZN_diff)
colSums(is.na(AMZN_diff))
AMZN_diff <- AMZN_diff[!is.na(AMZN_diff)]
```




### Data preprocessing for Google
```
GOOGL_closing <- Cl(to.daily(GOOGL))
GOOGL_dc <- Cl(to.monthly(GOOGL))
GOOGL_log <- log(GOOGL_closing)
GOOGL_diff <- diff(GOOGL_log, lag = 1)
anyNA(GOOGL_diff)
colSums(is.na(GOOGL_diff))
GOOGL_diff <- GOOGL_diff[!is.na(GOOGL_diff)]
```

### Plottings: 
Several plots were generated to visualize the data. For both AMZN and GOOGL, plots of the log returns and differenced log returns were created. These plots provide insights into the volatility and trends present in the stock prices.

### Plottings for Amazon

```
plot(AMZN_log, main = "AMZN log returns")
```
![](Rplot01.png)

```
plot(AMZN_diff, type = "l", main = "AMZN diff") 
```

![](Rplot02.png)



### Plottings for Google
```
plot(GOOGL_dc)
plot(GOOGL_log, main = "GOOGL log returns")
plot(GOOGL_diff, type = "l", main = "GOOGL diff")
```

### ACF & PACF:
Autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots were generated for the differenced log returns of both AMZN and GOOGL. These plots help identify the potential order of autoregressive and moving average terms in the ARIMA models.

### ACF and PACF for Amazon
```
require(astsa)
acf2(AMZN_diff, max.lag = 30)
```

### ARIMA Modeling: 

ARIMA models were fitted to the differenced log returns of AMZN and GOOGL. The models were tested with different combinations of autoregressive (AR), integrated (I), and moving average (MA) terms. The SARIMA function from the "astsa" package was used for modeling.

### ARIMA Model for Amazon
```
Res <- sarima(AMZN_diff,0,0,0)
```

![](Rplot04.png)

```
AMZN_fit1 <- sarima(AMZN_diff,0,1,0)
```

![](Rplot05.png)

```
AMZN_fit2 <- sarima(AMZN_diff,0,0,1)
```

![](Rplot06.png)

```
AMZN_fit3 <- sarima(AMZN_diff,1,0,0)
```
![](Rplot07.png)


### Apply model

```
arima_log <- arima(AMZN_log, order = c(0,1,0))
```
```
sarima(AMZN_log, 0,1,0)
```

![](Rplot08.png)




### ARIMA Model for Google
```
Res <- sarima(GOOGL_diff, 0, 0, 0)
```
![](Rplot14.png)
```
G_fit1 <- sarima(GOOGL_diff, 0, 1, 0)
```
![](Rplot15.png)
```
G_fit2 <- sarima(GOOGL_diff, 0, 0, 1)
```
![](Rplot16.png)

```
G_fit3 <- sarima(GOOGL_diff, 1, 0, 0)
```
![](Rplot17.png)

# Apply model
```
sarima(GOOGL_log, 0, 1, 0)
```

### Forecasting: 
SARIMA models were used to forecast the log returns for the next 24 periods for both AMZN and GOOGL. These forecasts provide an estimate of the future behavior of the stock prices based on the historical data

### Summary Statistics: 
Summary statistics were calculated for the ARIMA model fitted to the log returns of AMZN. The mean error (ME), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean percentage error (MPE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute scaled error (MASE), and the first-order autocorrelation coefficient (ACF1) were reported
